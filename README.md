# Polynomial_calculator
The polynomial calculator will find  the sum, difference, product of two polynomials, product with a scalar, result of the division of two polynomials and division by a scalar (quadratic, binomial, trinomial, etc.). Both univariate and multivariate polynomials are accepted. These operations are done using singly linked list.
 
FEATURES:
•	Inputs a first polynomial using a Polynomial class object with the freedom to input any no of coefficients with the desired power

•	Inputs a second polynomial in the same manner

•	Stores the two polynomials in two linked lists and displays them

•	Provides a menu driven program to perform some arithmetic operations on the two polynomials

•	Add operation: adds the two polynomials

•	Subtract operation: subtracts the two polynomials

•	Multiply by scalar operation: multiplies the desired polynomial with a scalar value given by the user

•	Multiplication operation: multiplies the two polynomials

•	Divide by scalar operation: divides the desired polynomial by a scalar value given by the user

•	Division operation: divides the two polynomials
